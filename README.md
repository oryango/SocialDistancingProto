# Social Distancing and Contact Tracing Wearable
This repository contains my prototype wearable that I created during the start of the pandemic. Some context on this project is that it was proposed way before the roll out of vaccines and then it was built the following school term (3 months later). By that time, news about the vaccine has started to come up and this wearable was only created for academic requirement.

My paper on the prototype is found inside the repository and should suffice if more information is needed on this project as well as the code for the prototype.
